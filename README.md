# Rainwash
A text-based game.

***Rainwash is not finished. It has no story line, lots of unimplemented features, and a couple of features that aren't usefull yet. For all intents and purposes, this should be considered a debug version.
As such, by downloading any releases of Rainwash in this debug version, you (the downloader) acknowledge that some functionalities may not work as expected or may cause errors, and that any data created by your gameplay could be lost.
Lastly, a valid username and password are required in current builds in order to play. These will be used only to collect crash-report data.***

Before running Rainwash, you MUST run Setup. This creates all the required files that Rainwash needs to run. If you attempt to run Rainwash before Setup, it will crash.

Save files will not be compatible across all versions of Rainwash. In version x.y, save files will maintain structure across all values of y, but save files from different values of x will not be compatible unless otherwise noted. Downloads are availabe under 

Have fun!
