# Rainwash
A text-based game.

***Rainwash is not finished. It has no story line, lots of unimplemented features, and a couple of features that aren't usefull yet. For all intents and purposes, this should be considered a debug version.
As such, by downloading any releases of Rainwash in this debug version, you (the downloader) acknowledge that some functionalities may not work as expected or may cause errors, and that any data created by your gameplay could be lost.
Lastly, a valid email address and password are required in current builds in order to play. These will be used only to collect crash-report data.***

Before running Rainwash, you MUST run RWSetup. This creates all the required files that Rainwash needs to run. If you attempt to run Rainwash before Setup, it will crash.

Save files will not be compatible across all versions of Rainwash. In version x.y, save files will maintain structure across all values of y, but save files from different values of x will not be compatible unless otherwise noted. 

***Downloads are availabe under releases. Versioning is not semantic.

Good luck.

---HELP---

If you're stuck, type "Help." (without quotes) for a full command list.

**Please note that all commands require a period at the end EXCEPT prompted commands (i.e., responding directly to an option/question). Prompted commands will not accept periods.**

---CHANGELOG---

v1.2: 1-29-17: v1.2 marks Rainwash's 3000-lines-of-code milestone! Per user requests, input has been made significantly more flexible. New in v1.2:

-Shorteners for Container and Monster inputs. Instead of "giant wolf spider", one can now simply type "spider".

-Object persistance. When your inventory is full and you discover an item, you no longer lose an item from you inventory, instead, you place the new item on the ground. Items on the ground can be picked up with the "take" command. Additionally, dropped items are placed on the ground instead of being "washed away".

-Tweaks in the hunger mechanic, so that one does not instantly become hungry when fleeing.

-The dreaded "raw venison" bug has, once again, been fixed.


v1.1: 1-14-17: v1.1 is the first officially licensed version of Rainwash! It features:

-The "Help." command.

-Greatly increased vocabulary for both commands as well as monsters and containers.

-Handling for fatal errors (user intervention required).

-Clarification for multiple commands that would display nothing after improper input (such as invalid spellings of items).

-Some small tweaks for bug fixes and improved playability.


v1.01: 1-10-17: Released the same day as v1.0, this patch fixes some game-breaking bugs, and adds two small features.

-Fixed "Cut of Raw Venison" Typo.

-Fixed Armor Bonus Not Applied bug.

-Made a slight addition in health monitoring text.

-Added a five-second delay before exit upon death.



v1.0: 1-10-17: The first distribution of Rainwash marks about 1.5 years of on-and-off work. It features:

-Procedurally generated locations with biomes, containers (barrels, crates, etc.), monsters, and a few other variants.

-A brutal turn-based attack system designed to put risk into battles.

-Items, including potions, scrolls, weapons, armor, etc.

-Story-like environmental interactions and combat, keeping the "numbers" behind the scenes.

-Character needs, like food and rest.

-And much more!
